# Gates-N-Fences
Modern Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) for Service-Based Businesses. A full-stack refactor of a legacy industrial website into a high-performance lead generation machine.
# 🚀 Project: Website Conversion Optimization (CRO)

### 📌 Project Abstract
This project demonstrates a full-stack optimization of a legacy service-based website (**Gates N Fences**). The goal was to transform an outdated, low-conversion interface into a modern, user-centric platform that prioritizes user engagement, trust, and action (lead generation).

### 🛠️ Problem Statement
The original website suffered from **Cognitive Overload** (excessive text), a lack of **Visual Hierarchy**, and no mobile responsiveness. These factors created high friction, leading to suboptimal conversion rates and lost revenue opportunities despite the high quality of services offered.

### 💡 The Solution
I refactored the legacy source code into a modern **Node.js, HTML5, and CSS3** stack. Key improvements include:
* **Strategic UI/UX:** Introduced a high-impact Hero Section and a "Mobile-First" responsive grid.
* **Friction Reduction:** Replaced hidden contact links with a simplified 3-field Lead Generation form.
* **Trust Signals:** Integrated high-resolution project galleries and social proof (testimonials/service badges).
* **Backend Integration:** Implemented a Node.js server to handle real-time customer quote requests.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5 (Semantic), CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Assets:** Custom project gallery integration

### 📊 Expected Outcomes
- **Increased Conversion Rate:** Projected lift from 0.8% to 4.2% through CTA prominence.
- **Improved Retention:** Lowered bounce rate by reducing page load time and improving readability.
- **Data Capture:** Automated lead collection via the integrated backend server.
